    Everytime we declare a protocol it should be where the main scruct is.
    We use protocols so they can be called (just like with the classes) but the
    functions we declare inside a protocol are mandatory.
    
    For example: our protocol named WeatherManagerDelegate has two functions
    called didUpdateWeather and didFailWithError, both recieve parameters
    but as a rule, functions in protocols does not have body so when we
    use them elsewhere we have the liberty to use them with their called parameters
    for the reason we may need them.
